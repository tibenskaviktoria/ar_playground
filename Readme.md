This is my AR-playground.

After cloning don't forget to create a virtual environment as the first thing.

```
python -m venv .venv
```

Then you need to activate it.

On Windows:

```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then you need to install the dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you're good to go.
